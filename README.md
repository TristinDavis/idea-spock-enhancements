Spock Enhancements is a plugin for IntelliJ IDEA that improves integration with the Spock specification framework (http://code.google.com/p/spock/)

The plugin provides:
* Font changes for the Spock labels. The font change can be configured under IDE Settings -> Spock.
* Inspections to highlight block ordering errors such as an expect block following a when block. The inspections appear under Groovy -> Spock.
